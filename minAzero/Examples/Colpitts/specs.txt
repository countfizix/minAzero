# Data file for minAzero.py
# Includes the problem length
# because midpoint method is used, 2N+1 data points will be used - you are providing N here
100
# How much data to skip
# In case you do not want to start at the beginning of the data file
10
# Time step - this is twice the time step of the data,
# since the data includes time and midpoints.
0.2
# File name - input
testx.dat
# Data File name - stimuli
# No stimuli for this problem
# Boundary & initial conditions
# 0 for no initial data file, 1 for data file
# A data file must include values for all state variables
# at each time point.
0
# If above is 1, list name of data file next.  If 0, no entry needed.

# State Variables:
# These are in the formats: lower bound, upper bound, initial guess, Rf

# z
-100, 100, 1,1
# Parameter initial conditions and bounds - no Rf as time independent.

# DiscAzero.py skips over any line that begin with #
# Proper format is:
# First line is problem name
# Second line is number of equations (w/o cost), number of parameters, number of controls,
# number of external stimuli (for instance, injected current)
# Following lines list the equations
# With the cost function last
# Then the variable names (in same order as equations)
# NOTE: DO NOT use single character variable names or variable names that include another
#  variable name!  For example, using p1 and p11 in the same problem would be bad.
# Parameter names used in equations
# Control names used in equations
# Data names used in equations
